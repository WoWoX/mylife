	 <p class="title">10.3 Frequently Asked Questions</p>
		
		<p class="faq_q">&raquo; What is the advantage of using the RedBox, instead of using Red5 or Flash Media Server directly?</p>
		<p class="faq_a">
			The <strong>RedBox</strong> offers a tight integration with the SmartFoxServer API, providing an extremely powerful environment for
			developing multiplayer applications with embedded A/V capabilities.<br>

			With the only use of Red5 or FMS you don't get any advanced room management, buddy lists, chat filters, security etc... 				
			The synergy between the two applications can literally save you months of development!
		</p>
		
		<p class="faq_q">&raquo; Does the RedBox use a second connection for Audio/Video streaming?</p>
		<p class="faq_a">
			Yes. The RTMP protocol works on port 1935 and its data traffic is separated from the SmartFoxServer protocol.<br>
			There are many advantages with this approach, the main one is that you can even dedicate one server machine for the RedBox, 
			if you have very high A/V traffic.
		</p>
		
		<p class="faq_q">&raquo; Is Red5 started when SmartFoxServer boots?</p>
		<p class="faq_a">
			By default no. You can start it separately if your application needs the RedBox streaming services.
		</p>
		
		<p class="faq_q">&raquo; Which version of Red5 is distributed with the RedBox?</p>
		<p class="faq_a">
			Currently the RedBox includes a "light-weight" version of Red5 0.6.3 that was cleaned of the default examples and a few other files.<br>
			If you need the original additional examples you can visit the <a href="http://osflash.org/red5" title="Red5 : Open Source Flash Server Open Source Flash" target="_blank">Red5 website</a> and download the full release.
		</p>
		
		<p class="faq_q">&raquo; Will the RedBox work with other versions of Red5?</p>
		<p class="faq_a">
			It is highly likely but we cannot guarantee it. The RedBox was exclusively tested with Red5 0.6.3
		</p>
		
		<p class="faq_q">&raquo; Is the RedBox add-on compatible with Flash Media Server?</p>
		<p class="faq_a">
			Yes, the <strong>RedBox</strong> is based on the <a href="http://osflash.org/red5" title="Red5 : Open Source Flash Server Open Source Flash" target="_blank">Red5</a> RTMP server, an open-source alternative to Adobe Flash Media Server,
			which implements the Adobe RTMP protocol.
		</p>
		
		<p class="faq_q">&raquo; Would it be possible to use Flash Media Server or Wowza Media Server instead of Red5?</p>
		<p class="faq_a">
			In theory yes, because they all speak the same protocol. (RTMP)<br>
			The RedBox however makes use of a small Red5 server side application that should translated for the alternative RTMP server chosen. Being a very simple application it shouldn't be too difficult to translate.
		</p>
		
		<p class="faq_q">&raquo; Where does the RedBox keep the recorded media files?</p>
		<p class="faq_a">
			The files are located in the Server/RedBox/webapps/SFS_RedBox/streams/ folder inside your SmartFoxServer installation directory
		</p>
		
		<p class="faq_q">&raquo; Can I run the RedBox addon on a separate dedicated server?</p>
		<p class="faq_a">
			Yes. In order to do so, you should follow the steps below:
			<ul>
				<li>Copy the RedBox folder to your dedicated server</li>
				<li>Share the RedBox folder in your local network so that it can be accessed by the machine running SmartFoxServer</li>
				<li>
					Edit the <strong>redbox.properties</strong> file found in the <strong>Server/</strong> folder of the SmartFoxServer installation
					and point the <strong>red5Path</strong> value to the shared RebBox folder.
				</li>
				<li>Start both the RebBox and SmartFoxServer PRO</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		
		<p class="faq_q">&raquo; Is the RedBox project open source?</p>
		<p class="faq_a">
			Yes it is. The source code is distributed together with the SmartFoxServer PRO installer, under the BSD license.<br>
			You can learn more about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_license" title="BSD licenses - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia" target="_blank">license here</a>.
		</p>
		
		<p class="faq_q">&raquo; Do you offer specific Red5 support?</p>
		<p class="faq_a">
			We provide help for the RedBox API but we don't offer specific Red5 technical help.<br> 
			You can find help for any Red5 related problem in the <a href="http://osflash.org/red5" title="Red5 : Open Source Flash Server Open Source Flash" target="_blank">official Red5 website</a>
